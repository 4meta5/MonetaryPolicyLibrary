## Inflation <a name="inflation"></a>
* Producer Prices today
* Consumer Prices tomorrow
* import prices Friday
* Consumer Inflation Expectations Friday
* Inflation may no longer be the first or best indicator of a tight labor market and rising pressures on resource utilization. Part of the reason inflation sends a weaker signal is undoubtedly the achievement of anchored inflation expectations and the related flattening of the Phillips curve.14 Whatever the cause, in the run-up to the past two recessions, destabilizing excesses appeared mainly in financial markets rather than in inflation. Thus, risk management suggests looking beyond inflation for signs of excesses. [Powell at Jackson Hole](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm)

### Inflation Expectations <a name="expectations"></a>
* Consumer confidence unexpectedly jumped in August to a cyclical high, suggesting that spending momentum may exceed current forecasts. The surge in August — the confidence index reached the highest level since late 2000 — came in well above consensus projections and stands in contrast to the decline in the University of Michigan survey.

### Hurricane Florence <a name="florence"></a>
* transitory; may need to focus on core measures instead of headline)

### Energy <a name="energy"></a>
* oil price predictions
* what percent of headline is this and what does core look like (cpi or pce)

## Labor Market <a name="labor"></a>
* JOLTs surprise
* NFIB Small Business Optimism
* lack of skilled labor; greater labor-cost pressures should catalyze productivity growth

### Wage Pressure <a name="wage"></a>
* Payroll gains have averaged more than 200,000 per month, a step-up from the 2017 pace and well above estimates of the pace necessary to absorb new entrants into the labor force

### Phillips Curve <a name="phillips"></a>
* Wage pressure; labor cost pressure -> increased productivity
* longer-run unemployment rate based on June SEP at 4.5%, but probably lower
* At 3.9 percent, the August unemployment rate was about 1/2 percentage point lower than the previous year. If unemployment continues to decline at the same rate as we have seen over the past year, we will soon see unemployment rates not seen since the 1960s. Historically, the few periods when resource utilization has been at similarly tight levels have tended to see elevated risks of either accelerating inflation or financial imbalances.

### Demographic <a name="demographic"></a>
* Among prime-age workers, the employment-to-population ratio is 79.3 percent, up almost 1 percentage point over the past year. These developments are heartening, suggesting the tight labor market is providing employment opportunities to more Americans.
* Women

## Financial Markets <a name="finance"></a>
* Corporate credit spreads are very narrow and equity valuations are elevated relative to historical patterns

### Leveraged Loans <a name="levfin"></a>
* Rising risks are notable in the corporate sector, where low spreads and loosening credit terms are mirrored by rising indebtedness among corporations that could be vulnerable to downgrades in the event of unexpected adverse developments. Leveraged lending is again on the rise; spreads on leveraged loans and the securitized products backed by those loans are low, and the Board's Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices suggests that underwriting standards for leveraged loans may be declining to levels not seen since 2005.

### Flattening Yield Curve <a name="yield"></a>
* One reason the term premium may be lower than in the past is the changed correlation between stock and bond returns, likely associated with changes in expected inflation outcomes.18 The other driver of the low level of the term premium globally is the asset purchases of central banks in several major economies.19 In this case, if the term premium rises as the effect of asset purchase programs diminishes, the effect may be to forestall an inversion of the long-dated yield curve.

## GDP <a name="gdp"></a>
* Components of GDP
* Q2 GDP: 4.2%. Look for investment to play an increasingly important role in economic growth as aggregate demand for goods and services remains strong and resource utilization tightens. [August 30, Bloomberg](https://newsletters.briefs.bloomberg.com/document/MklrS9P3Q1u3mQi2iNAqIw--_44z2uomgm88zps2hrn/in-focus)

## Fiscal Stimulus <a name="fiscal"></a>
* Moreover, the sizable fiscal stimulus that is in train is likely to provide a tailwind to growth in the second half of the year and beyond.2 From a position of full employment, the economy will likely receive a substantial boost from $1.5 trillion in personal and corporate tax cuts and a $300 billion increase in federal spending, with estimates suggesting a boost to the growth rate of real GDP of about 3/4 percent this year and next.3 [Brainard] -- May 31, 2018
* What are the risks here? 

### Housing <a name="housing"></a>
* weak new housing statistics in June (probably not improving)

### Trade Relations <a name="trade"></a>
* Net exports were a major story line in 2Q. The second print confirmed that trade activity picked up in anticipation of worsening tensions over tariffs. Exports were little changed from the first release, and remained a source of growth. Yet imports slowed in the latest revision, which, in turn, boosted the contributions to growth from the external sector. [August 30, Bloomberg](https://newsletters.briefs.bloomberg.com/document/MklrS9P3Q1u3mQi2iNAqIw--_44z2uomgm88zps2hrn/in-focus)
* Exchange rate acts as a mechanism for rebalancing -- making imports more expensive and exports cheaper.

### USD <a name="usd"></a>
* inextricably linked to [trade](#trade) (define the relation)

## Policy <a name="policy"></a>
* Brainard Speech on High Short-Term Fed Funds Neutral rate [Brainard](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20180912a.htm) -- September 12, 2018
    * In the latest FOMC SEP median path, by the end of next year, the federal funds rate is projected to rise to a level that exceeds the longer-run federal funds rate during a time when real GDP growth is projected to exceed its longer-run pace and unemployment continues to fall. The shift from headwinds to tailwinds may be expected to push the shorter-run neutral rate above its longer-run trend in the next year or two, just as it fell below the longer-run equilibrium rate following the financial crisis. Notably, the sizable fiscal stimulus in the pipeline is likely to continue to bolster the short-run neutral rate over the next two years. The relatively rich level of current asset valuations relative to historical levels is another factor that could push the short-run neutral rate above its longer-run value. As was noted in the recent FOMC minutes, corporate credit spreads are very narrow, and equity valuations are elevated relative to historical patterns, even after taking into account the low level of interest rates.12 Business and consumer confidence is high, which is also consistent with a higher shorter-run neutral rate of interest.

### Lags <a name="lags"></a>
* 3 types of lags: response lag, policy lag, implementation lag
